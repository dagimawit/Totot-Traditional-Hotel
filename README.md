                      Totot Traditional Hotel
Totot Traditional Hotel is the most well-known and excellent traditional eatery in Addis Abeba.
and since we all need to know how the traditional foods and drinks  are prepared there 
My goal is to build a website that can display the traditional foods and drinks prepared there
posted either weekly or daily by the master chief, who serves as the website administrator or admin, 
and that includes all the information about how the foods and drinks are prepared, their ingredients, 
their taking time   and to provide all the necessary details.Also the user can like the food/drink he/she likes
and if he/she want they can give a comment on the food/drink.
Using Node.js and Express, I created the backend.
